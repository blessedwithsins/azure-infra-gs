# Azure OSDU MVC - Data Partition Configuration

The `osdu` - `data_partition` template is intended to provision to Azure resources for an OSDU Data Partition.


__PreRequisites__

> If you have run the `common_prepare.sh` scripts then skip the below section for environment variables and go directly to Configure.

Requires the use of [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for environment variable management.


Set up your local environment variables

*Note: environment variables are automatically sourced by direnv*

Required Environment Variables (.envrc)
```bash
export ARM_TENANT_ID=""
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=""

# Terraform-Principal
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=""
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=""

# Terraform State Storage Account Key
export TF_VAR_remote_state_account=""
export TF_VAR_remote_state_container=""
export ARM_ACCESS_KEY=""

# Instance Variables
export TF_VAR_resource_group_location="centralus"
```

__Configure__

Navigate to the `terraform.tfvars` terraform file. Here's a sample of the terraform.tfvars file for this template.

```HCL
prefix = "osdu-mvp"

resource_tags = {
  contact = "<your_name>"
}

# Storage Settings
storage_shares = [ "airflowdags" ]
storage_queues = [ "airflowlogqueue" ]
```

__Provision__

Execute the following commands to set up your terraform workspace.

```bash
# This configures terraform to leverage a remote backend that will help you and your
# team keep consistent state
terraform init -backend-config "storage_account_name=${TF_VAR_remote_state_account}" -backend-config "container_name=${TF_VAR_remote_state_container}"

# This command configures terraform to use a workspace unique to you. This allows you to work
# without stepping over your teammate's deployments
TF_WORKSPACE="dp1-${UNIQUE}"
terraform workspace new $TF_WORKSPACE || terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
```

> Manually create a custom variable file to use for template configuration and edit as appropriate and desired.

See [Custom Variables](#custom-variables) section for sample properties that can be configured.

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars custom.tfvars
```

Execute the following commands to orchestrate a deployment.


```bash
# See what terraform will try to deploy without actually deploying
terraform plan -var-file custom.tfvars

# Execute a deployment
terraform apply -var-file custom.tfvars
```

Optionally execute the following command to teardown your deployment and delete your resources.

```bash
# Destroy resources and tear down deployment. Only do this if you want to destroy your deployment.
terraform destroy
```

## Testing

Please confirm that you've completed the `terraform apply` step before running the integration tests as we're validating the active terraform workspace.

Unit tests can be run using the following command:

```
go test -v $(go list ./... | grep "unit")
```

Integration tests can be run using the following command:

```
go test -v $(go list ./... | grep "integration")
```

## Custom Variables

### Enabling CORS on Blob Containers

To enable CORS rules on Blob Containers, add the variable `blob_cors_rule` in `custom.tfvars`.

```go

// Blob Storage CORS Rules
blob_cors_rule = [
  {
    allowed_headers = ["*"],
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "GET"],
    allowed_origins = ["https://test1.org", "https://test2.org"],
    exposed_headers = ["*"],
    max_age_in_seconds = 60
  },
  {
    allowed_headers = ["*"],
    allowed_methods = ["PUT"],
    allowed_origins = ["https://test3.org"],
    exposed_headers = ["*"],
    max_age_in_seconds = 60
  }
]
```

### Enabling Storage Management Policy on file-staging-area container

Storage management policy is applied on the file-staging-area container where it can be decided to retain the data in it for a specified number of days.To enable Storage management policy on file-staging-area Containers, add the variable `storage_mgmt_policy_enabled` as a `feature_flag` in `custom.tfvars`.Override the default retention days using `sa_retention_days`.

```go

// Enable Storage management policy
feature_flag = {
  storage_mgmt_policy_enabled = true
}

// Override the default retention days
sa_retention_days = 7
```
