# Azure OSDU R3 MVP Architecture

The `osdu` - R3 MVP Architecture solution template is intended to provision Managed Kubernetes resources like AKS and other core OSDU cloud managed services like Cosmos, Blob Storage and Keyvault.

## Cloud Resource Architecture

![Architecture](./docs/images/architecture.png "Architecture")


## Cost

Azure environment cost ballpark [estimate](). This is subject to change and is driven from the resource pricing tiers configured when the template is deployed.


## Prerequisites

1. Azure Subscription
1. An available Service Principal capable of creating resources.
1. Terraform and Go are locally installed.
1. Requires the use of [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
1. Install the required common tools (kubectl, helm, and terraform).  Note: Currently uses [Terraform 0.12.29](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.29/).


### Install the required tooling

This document assumes one is running a current version of Ubuntu. Windows users can install the Ubuntu Terminal from the Microsoft Store. The Ubuntu Terminal enables Linux command-line utilities, including bash, ssh, and git that will be useful for the following deployment. _Note: You will need the Windows Subsystem for Linux installed to use the Ubuntu Terminal on Windows_.


### Install the Azure CLI

For information specific to your operating system, see the [Azure CLI install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). You can also use [this script](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/tools/prereqs/setup_azure_cli.sh) if running on a Unix based machine.


## Provision the Common Resources

The script ./common_prepare.sh will conveniently setup the common things that are necessary to install infrastructure.
- Run the script with your subscription ID as the first argument and an optional unique string as the second argument.
- Note the files (azure-aks-gitops-ssh-key and azure-aks-node-ssh-key.pub) that have appeared in the .ssh directory.
You will need these in a later step.
- Note the output of this script creates a .envrc file used with `direnv` to automatically setup the required environment for installation.

> UNIQUE is used to generate uniqueness across all of azure.  _(3-5 characters)_

```bash
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your_subscription_id>
export UNIQUE=<your_unique>

./common_prepare.sh
```

This results in 2 service principals being created that need an AD Admin to `grant admin consent` on.

1. osdu-mvp-{UNIQUE}-terraform
2. osdu-mvp-{UNIQUE}-principal

__Installed Common Resources__

1. Resource Group
2. Storage Account
3. Key Vault
4. A principal to be used for Terraform _(Requires Grant Admin Approval)_
5. A principal to be used for the OSDU environment.
6. An application to be used for the OSDU environment. _(future)_
7. An application to be used for negative integration testing.

>Note: 2 Users are required to be created in AD for integration testing purposes manually and values stored in this Common Key Vault.


## Elastic Search Setup

Infrastructure assumes bring your own Elastic Search Instance at a version of 6.8.x and access information must be stored in the Common KeyVault.

```bash
ENDPOINT=""
USERNAME=""
PASSWORD=""
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "elastic-endpoint-ado-demo" --value $ENDPOINT
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "elastic-username-ado-demo" --value $USERNAME
az keyvault secret set --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --name "elastic-password-ado-demo" --value $PASSWORD

cat >> .envrc_${UNIQUE} << EOF

# https://cloud.elastic.co
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export TF_VAR_elasticsearch_endpoint="$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --id https://$COMMON_VAULT.vault.azure.net/secrets/elastic-endpoint-ado-demo --query value -otsv)"
export TF_VAR_elasticsearch_username="$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --id https://$COMMON_VAULT.vault.azure.net/secrets/elastic-username-ado-demo --query value -otsv)"
export TF_VAR_elasticsearch_password="$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name $COMMON_VAULT --id https://$COMMON_VAULT.vault.azure.net/secrets/elastic-password-ado-demo --query value -otsv)"

EOF

cp .envrc_${UNIQUE} .envrc
```


## Create the Flux Manifest Repository

[Create an empty git repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo?view=azure-devops) with a name that clearly signals that the repo is used for the Flux manifests. For example `k8-gitops-manifests`.

Flux requires that the git repository have at least one commit. Initialize the repo with an empty commit.

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initializing the Flux Manifest Repository"
```


## Configure Key Access in Manifest Repository

The public key of the [RSA key pair](#create-an-rsa-key-pair-for-a-deploy-key-for-the-flux-repository) previously created needs to be added as a deploy key. Note: _If you do not own the repository, you will have to fork it before proceeding_.

Use the contents of the Secret as shown above.

Next, in your Azure DevOPS Project, follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=current-page#step-2--add-the-public-key-to-azure-devops-servicestfs) to add your public SSH key to your ADO environment.


## Manual Deployment Process
Follow these steps if you wish to deploy manually without pipeline support.

__Deploy Central Resources__

Follow the directions in the [`central_resources`](./central_resources/README.md) environment.

__Deploy Data Resources__

Follow the directions in the [`data_resources`](./data_partition/README.md) environment.

__Deploy Service Resources__

Follow the directions in the [`service_resources`](./service_resources/README.md) environment.
